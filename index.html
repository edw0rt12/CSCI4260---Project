        <h2 class="section__title">The Tao of UXD</h2>
        <p class="section__lead">
          This chapter is basically an introduction to the UX mindset. It argues that UX design is about shaping the full
          experience people have with a product or service—not just how a screen looks. It also frames what kind of
          person tends to enjoy UX work and how designers grow through community.

            <h3 class="card__title">Curiosity Meets Passion Meets Empathy</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              The authors describe UX designers as people who naturally ask “why” and “what if.” Curiosity helps you
              notice patterns and question assumptions. Passion keeps you motivated to improve things instead of
              accepting “good enough.” Empathy is the part that makes you care about how users feel when something is
              confusing, stressful, or just annoying.

              <p class="callout__text">
                UX is not just “designing a nice UI.” It’s more like being the person who can’t stop noticing when a
                process is awkward—and then actually tries to fix it.

            <h3 class="card__title">What Is User Experience Design?</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              The book gives a broad definition of UX as everything that shapes how users experience an organization’s
              products and services. That includes physical touchpoints (like packaging or environment), social
              touchpoints (like customer service), and digital touchpoints (like apps and websites). For this class, the
              book mainly focuses on digital experiences—interactive media like websites and apps—while reminding you
              that the “real world” still affects how people use digital products.

            <h3 class="card__title">About UX Designers</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              A big theme is balance: UX designers need both logic and emotion. Logic is the structure—clear navigation,
              usable flows, and realistic constraints (time, budget, tech). Emotion is trust, comfort, confidence, and
              delight. The chapter also hints that research and tools like personas are how designers avoid guessing and
              actually represent user needs.
            </p>

          <article id="ch1-where-live" class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Where UX Designers Live</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              UX is a community-driven field: groups, conferences, meetups, online communities, and courses help you
              learn faster and meet people. The authors basically encourage you to build a network and keep learning
              because UX changes as tools and technology change.

      <section id="chapter2" class="section">
        <div class="section__kicker">Chapter 2</div>
        <h2 class="section__title">The Project Ecosystem</h2>
        <p class="section__lead">
          Chapter 2 explains why UX work is never “just design.” Every project has an ecosystem: what you’re building,
          what devices people will use, who is on the team, and how the company operates. If you understand that context,
          you can make better design decisions and communicate better with stakeholders.
        </p>

        <div class="cards">
          <article id="ch2-product" class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Identify the Type of Product</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              The book describes four product types that shape design goals: brand presence (main company site),
              promotional products (campaigns/microsites meant to drive a specific action), content sources (large bodies
              of information people browse or search), and task-based applications (tools that help users complete
              workflows). Knowing the type helps you predict what matters most—messaging, conversion, discoverability,
              or efficiency.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article id="ch2-devices" class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Consider Different Devices</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              Device differences change UX decisions because screens, inputs, and contexts vary a lot. The chapter
              pushes a “mobile-first” mindset: starting with constraints helps you focus on essential actions and
              content. It also explains responsive design (flexible grids/images + media queries) and compares options
              like responsive sites, mobile web apps, and native apps, each with tradeoffs in cost, reach, and user
              experience.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article id="ch2-hats" class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Choose Your Hats</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              UX designers often wear multiple hats depending on team size and maturity. The chapter outlines common
              roles like information architect, interaction designer, UI designer, product designer, and user
              researcher. It also lists related roles you might collaborate with—or sometimes take on yourself—like
              product manager, content strategist, UX writer, business analyst, and front-end developer.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article id="ch2-culture" class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Understand the Company Culture</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              Culture affects how work gets done: company size, design maturity, hierarchy, pace, and logistics. The
              chapter argues that designers should learn how decisions are made, who has influence, and what past
              project history created (good or bad). This helps you advocate for users without fighting the org every
              step of the way.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article id="ch2-pull" class="card">
            <h3 class="card__title">Pulling It Together</h3>
            <p class="card__text">
              The point is that UX design happens inside real constraints: people, processes, and platforms. If you know
              the ecosystem early, you can set expectations, plan better, and avoid surprises mid-project. It’s like
              doing “context research” on the project itself.
